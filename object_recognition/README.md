I chose to implement all methods from scratch because it seemed like fun.


The 5 objects I chose to identify are my wallet, my nail clipper, a key, a quarter, and a nintendo switch controller

Todos:
Task 1 
    - create function that creates a binary mask where 1 represents object of interest for the 5 given objects ( should use some form of color thresholing that is smart like ISODATA algorithm)
    - run this function on a video stream, and display the output in a separate window
    - also include a tester program that can just run this on individual images for debugging
