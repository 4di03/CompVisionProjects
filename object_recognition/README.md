I decided to implement thresholding from scratch, including the kmeans implementation. The other methods were also implemented mostly from scratch.
Furthermore, I opt to build a real-time object recognizer (`real_time_or` binary), but have also included a binary (`image_or`) that can be used for running object recognition on an individual image for testing purposes.


The 5 objects I chose to identify are my wallet, my nail clipper, a key, a quarter, and a nintendo switch controller
